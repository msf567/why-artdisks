the problem
	
	the work is already in a window, why do it again
	the work doesnt need to be about computers just because it is on one
	the work doesnt need to be in a piece of software
	the work doesnt need to be climbing the tower of simulation
	the work doesnt need to be more digital images

a solution
	
	find ways of abandoning the window
	talk about something else besides how much you love your phone/computer/internet
	jump between multiple software packages
	stop taking credit for engineers' work
	don't focus on image production
